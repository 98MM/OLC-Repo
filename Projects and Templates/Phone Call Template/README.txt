INSTRUCTIONS

Step 1. Donwload the project folder 
Step 2. Open the project. Notice all the scene objects labeled “[EDIT ME]” and the Resources labeled “[REPLACE ME]”. You will be changing these to add your own profile photo, username and video.

Step 3. In the Orthographic Camera, find the “Username[EDIT ME]” scene object. Click this and look in the “Inspector” to the left of the preview person. Change the text to your name.

Step 4. Create your own profile photo inside a circle as a transparent PNG file. Make sure it is compressed and small enough so it is under 50KB. Add this photo to your project, and change the “Profile Photo[EDIT ME]” scene object to that profile photo texture.

Step 5. Create your own fake video to replace the adorable dog currently in the project. NOTE: your video will need to be under 3.5MB, so try running it through www.videosmaller.com several times. I scaled the video width to 640 and that helped a lot. Add your video to the project, and add it to the “Fake Video[EDIT ME]” Scene object.

Step 6. Click “The Call[EDIT ME]” Script scene object. In the inspector, add your fake video where it says “The Call”. Change the Video length to match your videos length so it will restart the lens when the video is done.

Step 7. Have a bunch of fake virtual phone calls with people around the world and enjoy!
